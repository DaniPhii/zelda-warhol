Zelda Warhol
============

Project for NDS to apply a [Warhol filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Diptych) to a picture of [Zelda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Zelda).
The picture has been previously processed with [Sobel operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator).
In fact, processing the image with Sobel operator was compulsory to get a better result.

You'll need [devkitPro](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/) (at least [devkitARM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/) and [libnds](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/libnds/)). You can use [No$GBA](http://www.nogba.com/), but I recommend [DeSmuME](http://www.desmume.com/) as it can be linked to [GDB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger).
